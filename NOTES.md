# notes

* Change colors
* Show animal on screen
* Make presets for animals
* Pick a random animal
* HP & LP filter for narrowing the possible frequency band (on mic)
* When being in a frequency for too long, jump somewhere else!
* Add more voices in octave
* LFO per voice, maybe the outer ones need a different speed?
* Add Majda features to control certain parameters (like distortion, controlled by "sharpness feature")
* Use noise sometimes instead of sines
